# NeuralGumbel

Train a encoder with a window to output a probability value by virtue of GUMbel. 
Use the gumber and evolve in time. Then, push the probability value to get back the x in a decoder map. 

statistics fit for u sigma--> GEV evolve mu sigma --> forecast mu sigma --> reconstruct distributions
